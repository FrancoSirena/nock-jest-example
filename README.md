# Example on how Nock + Jest work

This is just an example on how Nock and Jest works and how we can find trouble with it.

I try to ilustrate how to mock `axiios` in the right way to avoid issues and how we can tackle the common memory leak issues.

This repo is base for my article that can be found here:
